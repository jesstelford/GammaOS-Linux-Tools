# Linux-based GammaOSNext Flashing (Unisoc T820)
---

## Flashing Requirements

- libusb
- python3 (3.7+)
- A fully downloaded and decompressed GammaOSNext .pac file

**Debian/Ubuntu**
```bash
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0 python3
```

**macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel)

No extra packages are needed: `tools/spd_dump-darwin` is a universal binary with libusb built in, and `python3` comes with the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) or Homebrew.

- On Apple Silicon, macOS asks *"Allow accessory to connect?"* the first time a new USB device is plugged in. The device only stays in flashing mode for a short window, so either be ready to click **Allow** immediately, or first set **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow accessories to connect** to *Automatically when unlocked*.
- `sudo` is still required: macOS attaches its own driver to the device and only root can detach it.

## Rebuilding `spd_dump` for macOS

Both `tools/spd_dump` (Linux) and `tools/spd_dump-darwin` (macOS) are built from [TomKing062's fork of spreadtrum_flash](https://github.com/TomKing062/spreadtrum_flash) at commit `d24c21a` — the fork adds the `exec_addr`, `set_active` and `firstmode` commands this script depends on. The macOS build has libusb 1.0.29 linked statically. To rebuild it for your own architecture:

```bash
brew install libusb
git clone https://github.com/TomKing062/spreadtrum_flash
cd spreadtrum_flash
echo "#define GIT_VER \"$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\"" > GITVER.h
echo "#define GIT_SHA1 \"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\"" >> GITVER.h
cc -O2 -std=c99 -Wno-unused -DUSE_LIBUSB=1 -I"$(brew --prefix libusb)/include" -o spd_dump-darwin spd_dump.c common.c \
    "$(brew --prefix libusb)/lib/libusb-1.0.a" -lm -lpthread -framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation -framework Security -lobjc
```
